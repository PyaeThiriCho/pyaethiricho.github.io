    <h3>Early life and struggles</h3>
    <p>Shah Rukh Khan was born on <strong>November 2, 1965</strong>, in <strong>New Delhi, India</strong>, into a middle-class family. His father, <strong>Meer Taj Mohammed Khan</strong>, was a freedom fighter, and his mother, <strong>Lateef Fatima</strong>, was a magistrate and social worker. He grew up in<strong> Rajendra Nagar</strong>, Delhi, where he attended <strong>St. Columba’s School</strong>, excelling in academics and sports, especially football and hockey. From a young age, he had a passion for acting and performed in stage plays, often imitating Bollywood legends.

        Despite a happy childhood, life took a tragic turn when he lost his father to cancer in 1981 and his mother in 1991. Left with his elder sister, he faced immense emotional and financial struggles but remained determined to fulfill his dreams. He pursued his education at <strong>Hansraj College</strong> and later joined <strong>Jamia Millia Islamia</strong> for a Master’s degree in Mass Communication but dropped out to follow his passion for acting.
        
        SRK started his career in television with Fauji (1989) and Circus (1989–1990), which earned him recognition. However, after his mother’s passing, he moved to Mumbai in 1991 with just a few belongings and big dreams. With no industry connections, he struggled to find roles but never gave up. His persistence paid off when he landed his first Bollywood role in Deewana (1992), marking the beginning of an extraordinary journey.
        
        His early struggles shaped him into the hardworking and resilient superstar he is today, proving that success is built on perseverance, passion, and self-belief.</p>
